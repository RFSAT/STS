        //   strictly greater than the last uploaded one, and a code reused
        //   during testing is impossible to tell apart afterwards.
        //
        // 1.4.0 — feature: registration by a square bounding box with
        //         draggable top-left and bottom-right handles, placed
        //         automatically from the detected black aiming mark and
        //         expanded to the whole scoring area by the face's own
        //         published ratio. Corner registration stays available for
        //         angled views, and the detector says when it is needed.
        //       — feature: ring values printed on the target plot at all four
        //         cardinal points, so the targets database shows scores on
        //         the circles.
        // 1.3.1 — correction: the photo-upload scoring entry points existed
        //         since 1.2.0 but were styled borderless — flat text under a
        //         filled button — and users could not find them. Both are now
        //         ordinary buttons, the Home one comes FIRST, and both read
        //         "Upload a target photo to score".
        // 1.3.0 — feature: Play Store listing material — short and full
        //         descriptions and the 1024x500 feature graphic, in play/.
        //         The graphic is generated from the SAME drawing as the icon
        //         (tools/generate_feature_graphic.py imports the icon's
        //         artwork), so the listing and the home screen cannot drift.
        // 1.2.1 — correction: applicationId is now com.STS, and CI builds
        //         release artefacts only (no debug APK). Signing degrades to
        //         unsigned rather than failing when no keystore is present.
        // 1.2.0 — feature: score a target from a photograph after the session
        //         (ImportActivity), and a shot distribution histogram shown on
        //         Results, live on Session, on the import screen and in the
        //         shared report.
        //       — correction found while writing its tests: ImageLoader's
        //         sample size used the common idiom that stops one step early
        //         and returns an image LARGER than the requested cap, so a
        //         50 MP photo decoded at 4080 px instead of 3000.
        // 1.1.0 — feature: real launcher and Play Store icon, generated from
        //         one drawing (tools/generate_icons.py) into the 512 px store
        //         asset, the adaptive foreground at five densities, and the
        //         Android 13+ monochrome layer.
        // 1.0.1 — correction: removed res/mipmap-hdpi/README.txt, which the
        //         resource merger rejects (res accepts only .xml and .png).
